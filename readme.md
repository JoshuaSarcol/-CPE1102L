# CPE 1102L (PROGRAMMING LOGIC AND DESIGN)
> exists as an archive

this repository contains all unfactored code and accompanying documentation of all outputs made for the above-mentioned subject as a first year computer engineer student in the university of san carlos

all code is in c
documentation includes pseudocodes and flowcharts



extra notes:
especially in the first few outputs, some implement subpar programming practices. i did not bother to refactor such mistakes. we'll just say that "_it shows the journey i took to become a proficient programmer_ :D"
