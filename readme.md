# CPE 1102L (PROGRAMMING LOGIC AND DESIGN)
> exists as an archive

This repository contains all unfactored code and accompanying documentation of all outputs made for the above-mentioned subject as a first year Computer Engineer student in the University of San Carlos

all code is in C

documentation includes pseudocodes and flowcharts



extra notes:

especially in the first few outputs, some implement subpar programming practices. i did not bother to refactor such mistakes. we'll just say that "_it shows the journey i took to become a proficient programmer_ :D"
